# cracking-rsa
cracking a weak rsa key and obtain n,e,p,q,d and private key with python,

#SCRIPT USAGE
1. the first script (public_key.py) can be used to crack the public key components(e and n)
2. The second script can be used to crack the private key components but also the public key components and save the rsa_key(private key)


## IDEA BEHIND
1. mathematical foundation in information security
2. cryptography
3. cracking weak rsa
